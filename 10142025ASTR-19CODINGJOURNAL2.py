#First, I will assign variables to the floating numbers and integers
x = 3.77
y = 5.0
i1 = 2
i2 = 8

#Second, I will print the sum of two floating point numbers and print the data type of the answer
print(x+y)
print(type(x+y))

#Third, I will print the difference between two integers and print the data type of the answer
print(i1-i2)
print(type(i1-i2))

#Finally, I will print the product of a floating point number and an integer
#and I will print the data type of the answer
print(x*i2)
print(type(x*i2))
